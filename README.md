IN my past i did programs in c language but when i starting my coding in python.so, i experienced that is easy the c language

At first i took the help from tutors in our campus and also from youtube.
it help me to give knowledge of basic python.
then after i did the practice in coding and i got grip in python.

i submitted two files in the research.
1)20220674
2)assignment
 
IN 20220674 there are three codes which are basic.

In assignment name of file there are 2 codes which are intresting but it took hour of work to solve error.
